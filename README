Murpi â€“ Murphystic Pictures
===========================

It is possible to hang up a picture on two nails such that it falls
down if only one of the two nails breaks. Since this is some kind
of optimization of Murphy's law, I call such an arrangement
"murphystic". This can be generalized to any number of nails and
is a popular funny exercise on the theory of fundamental groups.

Murpi is a program that generates such arrangements and visializes
them as PostScript files. It is implemented in C++ and can be
compiled as follows:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

There is also a collection of sample outputs (converted to PDF):
